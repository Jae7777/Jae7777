# Hello, I'm Justin 👋

I've been coding for as long as this Github Account's been made.

So... it's been about 3 years.

I learned a lot, that I can say confidently. I think I'm going to keep going. Cheers to the future 🍻

I do other stuff outside of coding. You can find more through my other profiles

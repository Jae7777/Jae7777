# Hello, I'm Justin 👋

My online tags are Jae | Jaえ | Jae7777 | YourMajestryRegis | etc.

I've been coding for as long as this Github Account's been made.

Which... has been about 3 years.

I learned a lot, that I can say confidently. I think I'm going to keep going. See what I'm working on 🔗[here](https://www.flatlined.gg/mischief)

Outside of coding I like to make music, art, and food. And outside of making, I like fashion, books, and tech.

# Hello, I'm Justin o/

I've been coding for as long as this Github Account's been made.

Which... has been about 3 years.

I often feel like a late bloomer. I started coding at 18, far later than some of the geniuses I know. Sometimes I regret not starting sooner.

But I think I'm progressing fine. I learned a lot, that I can say confidently. I will keep on progressing. Here's what I'm working on ðŸ”—[here](https://www.flatlined.gg/mischief)

Outside of coding I like to make music, art, and food. And outside of making, I like fashion, books, and tech.

# Hello, I'm Justin ðŸ‘‹

I do web dev. And game dev. And... quantum dev? Mobile app dev too. I forgot the rest :]

I swear I have a life outside of coding. I enjoy creating and performing music. Bad at art but it's a fun pastime. Love running and the light feeling of the world passing by but hate the gasping for air afterwards. Maybe you're not here for this. That's fine, I got days worth of repos for you to look through ^^
